Landing page is the current top 25 manga.

API fetch calls are limited, so when searching it takes awhile (not good). Not the best solution, but I created artificial delay between fetches to prevent fetch errors.

Instead im working on either a load more button that appears below the 25 manga, or when you get to the bottom of the page it auto loads.

For testing: When on the search page, type "Naruto" in the search box. Then after you see the results, type "JoJo" in the search box. You will notice the delay (big depending on amount results/hits) in search time due to what I discussed above.

* API calls are made with the SFW filter (safe for work)
