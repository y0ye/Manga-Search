Scuffed but works.

API fetch calls are limited, so when searching it takes awhile (not good). Probably not the best solution, but I created artificial delay between fetches to prevent fetch errors.

Instead im working on either a load more button that appears below the 25 manga, or when you get to the bottom of the page it auto loads.

* API calls are made with the SFW filter (safe for work), but sometimes some stuff makes it thru....
